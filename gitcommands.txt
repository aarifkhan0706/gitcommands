1. Initiating : $ git init
2. Selecting the file lets say index.html : $ git add index.html
3. Commiting the file : $ git -m commit
4. Adding the remote in order to upload the file : $ git remote add origin(remote name) url_link(remote URL) 
5. Uploading the files to a remote : $ git push origin master
6. Downloading the files from a remote : $ git pull origin master
** These are the basics of sharing a file and downloading that file .
** One should always know what files are being shared so that uncomplete file or incorrect code is not shared
7. To check if there is any changes made : $ git status 
8. To check the difference or recognizing the changes made :  $ git diff
9. How to check the commits made by anyone : $ git log
10. Can i also see what changes done by anyone making the commit : $ git log -p
** you can use up and lower arrow key to see the commit and changes and press 'Q' to quit
